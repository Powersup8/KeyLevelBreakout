Today I'm going to show you an extremely
0:03
reliable,
0:04
repetitable, and mechanical scalping
0:07
strategy. It's called the touch and turn
0:10
scalper, and it takes advantage of the
0:12
first 90 minutes of the market open. My
0:15
name is Carl and I've been trading for
0:17
over 20 years. already when I was 19
0:19
years old competing in the Swedish
0:21
championship for stock trading. The
0:23
winner who beat me and who later became
0:26
my trading mentor, he was using this
0:28
exact strategy trading Netflix. And in
0:31
today's video, I will present it the
0:33
same way that he showed me back in 2010
0:35
and the same way that I have taught
0:37
hundreds of traders since. We've all
0:40
used it day in and day out to make solid
0:42
trades for years. I'm going to show you
0:44
how to trade this touch and turn scalper
0:46
in just three simple steps. Then after
0:48
explaining the three steps, I will take
0:50
that process and I will trade it in the
0:52
live market so that you know how to
0:54
apply it. Let's get started. I just love
0:57
this strategy and most people that I
0:58
show it to like it as well because it's
1:01
mechanical, it's straightforward and it
1:03
doesn't require any complex structure.
1:06
Step one is to Fibonaccify the opening
1:09
range.
1:12
So, first open whatever asset you are
 Step 1: Fibonacci the Opening Range
1:15
trading on a 15minute chart. For
1:18
nostalgic reasons, I will um use Netflix
1:22
just as my mentor did back in 2010. It
1:25
works with any assets. Just make sure
1:26
it's a 15-minute chart. From there, let
1:29
the first 15 minutes of the market open
1:31
pass, allowing that opening candle to
1:33
completely close. Once that candle has
1:36
closed, use the Fibonacci retracement
1:39
drawing tool. So what we want to do here
1:41
is to draw the Fibonacci levels from the
1:43
highest price point that we see. So this
1:45
very top of the week down to the lowest
1:49
price point that we see, which is the
1:51
very bottom of this week. And then we
1:54
extend it into the future. And that's
1:56
all for step one. I told you it was
1:59
going to be simple. So we now got three
2:02
different price levels within the range
2:03
here. For this strategy though, we're
2:05
only interested in the 38.2 2 level and
2:09
the 61.8 level. These are the target
2:12
profit levels that we will use in this
2:14
strategy. But for now, this is all you
2:16
need to do. Just draw it from the high
2:18
to low range and extend it into the
2:21
future. Now, let's move on to step
2:22
number two, which is a crucial step and
2:24
a step that I have in all of my opening
2:26
range strategies. The step is to confirm
2:28
that the opening candle is what we call
 Step 2: Confirm the Liquidity Candle (ATR Method)
2:31
a liquidity candle.
2:37
So most likely it is and I will explain
2:40
why soon. And if it is, we are on to
2:44
something special.
2:46
A liquidity candle is any fast
2:48
aggressive candle moving up or down. The
2:51
direction doesn't matter. It's quick,
2:53
it's forceful, and it moves decisively
2:55
in one direction. But it's more than
2:57
just a candle. It's actually an
2:59
emotional event. And that is where the
3:01
edge is. When traders all around the
3:03
world see these, their very first
3:05
instinct is to chase this move afraid
3:08
that they will miss out on this trading
3:10
opportunity. And that's exactly what
3:12
these candles are designed to do, to
3:14
pull in inexperienced retail traders to
3:17
create liquidity necessary for the
3:19
larger institutions to get in and out of
3:22
their big positions. So this move
3:24
actually needs to happen for the larger
3:25
institutions to get in and out and that
3:27
is why you will see them almost every
3:30
day. This often involves an aggressive
3:33
push of the price in one direction to
3:35
trigger clusters of stop- losses from us
3:38
retail traders. And those triggered
3:40
stop- losses will generate the liquidity
3:43
necessary for the institutions to fill
3:45
their positions without dramatically
3:47
moving the price. So without this
3:50
engineer liquidity, big players couldn't
3:52
trade in size without negatively
3:55
impacting their entry and exit levels.
3:57
The best explanation for this comes from
4:00
our late Dr. David Paul.
4:02
The best trades occur after the masses
4:05
have been stopped out. And that's
4:07
because the big fellas up there. They
4:09
can't press the Wii button and get in
4:11
because there's just not enough
4:14
liquidity there for them to get in in
4:16
size. So they have to in fact engineer
4:19
100,000 guys like you, sir, pull you one
4:23
way, your stop loss gets hit. that in
4:26
fact sets off a sea of liquidity for
4:28
them to get in.
4:29
So yeah, these candles they are
4:30
engineered and that is why we can also
4:33
call them manipulation candles. They
4:35
happen daily allowing those larger
4:37
institutions to enter and exit their
4:39
trades. So the most important thing to
4:41
understand how this touch and turn
4:42
scalper is taking advantage of this very
4:45
phenomenon is that whenever you see
4:48
those candles most of the time the
4:51
candle will be reversed. And right
4:53
there, that's the strategy. That is the
4:55
edge that we are using. Now, just in
4:58
case there's any doubt in your mind
4:59
whether or not what you're looking at is
5:01
or is not a manipulation candle, let me
5:03
show you an easy way to figure that out.
5:06
So, what we want to do is to switch to
5:07
the daily chart of the asset that we're
5:09
trading and add the average true range
5:12
indicator. You don't have to make any
5:14
adjustments to it. Just use the default
5:15
setting of 14 days. This indicator will
5:19
give us a numerical value and in this
5:21
case for Netflix it's three bucks 53.
5:26
I'll just go ahead and write that down.
5:32
So what does this number represent?
5:35
Well, it represents the average range of
5:39
Netflix for the last 14 days. So, either
5:42
up 3.53 bucks or down 3.53 bucks on an
5:46
average day. 3.53. 3.53.
5:50
Why is it so hard to say? 3.53.
5:56
So, the opening trading range is one of
5:59
the most important parameters for us
6:01
being successful as traders, whether or
6:03
not you use this touch and turn strategy
6:05
or something else. And here's what we
6:07
want to determine. So, back on the
6:09
15-minute chart, if the size of the
6:12
candle that we boxed in is 25% or more
6:15
of that daily range, then it is a
6:18
manipulation candle. So, here's the
6:21
basic math to figure that out. So, we
6:23
take our 3.53 bucks, right? And we
6:26
multiply it with 25%, which gets you 88.
6:31
So if the high of that candle to the low
6:34
of that candle exceeds 88 cents then it
6:37
is a manipulation candle. So you'll see
6:41
that the very low of this candle is
6:45
93.24 24 bucks and the very high is 94.7
6:51
bucks and that is around 1.5 bucks which
6:56
is well outside that 88 cent range. So
7:01
this is definitely a manipulation
7:03
candle. So that wraps up step number two
7:06
which also was pretty simple. Right now
 Step 3: Dialing in the Perfect Limit Order
7:08
let's move on to step number three which
7:10
is to make the perfect trade for this
7:13
setup. And that's going to be pretty
7:16
simple, too.
7:18
So, we're going to go back to that
7:20
15inut chart and we are going to move it
7:23
to a smaller time frame. So, for this
7:25
strategy, I prefer to use the one minute
7:28
time frame and that's what I'm going to
7:31
continue to use in the rest of this
7:33
demonstration. So, this is how the
7:34
15minut opening range looks like on a
7:37
one minute time frame. So, what we want
7:39
to do here is to place the limit order
7:40
at the edge of the range. A limit order
7:42
is an order that you place to instruct
7:44
your trading software to enter a trade
7:46
only when the price reaches that
7:49
specific level. And as the manipulation
7:51
candle was negative with a high chance
7:53
of reversing, I want to place a limit
7:56
order to go long at the low of the
7:59
range. If the manipulation candle was
8:01
positive, I would instead place a limit
8:03
order to go short and I would place it
8:05
at the high of the range. The reason
8:07
that this strategy is called a touch and
8:08
turn is because what usually happens
8:10
when we have had a confirmed liquidity
8:12
candle open is that the price will at
8:15
least one more time touch the low and
8:18
then turn.
8:20
So what we want to do here is placing a
8:22
long limit order and we are placing it
8:24
here. And then what we want to do is to
8:26
set a target profit level to the 38.2
8:30
Fibonacci level. So this is a level that
8:32
the price usually goes back to whenever
8:34
we have a touch and turn. And then what
8:36
I want to do is to set the stop-loss
8:38
level. And I want to set it so that we
8:40
have a 2:1 riskreward ratio. So this
8:43
means that we want the target profit to
8:45
be two times bigger than the stop- loss.
8:47
And the target profit here is uh 56
8:51
cents which means that our stop loss
8:53
should be uh half of that which is 28
8:57
cents which would be uh right here. So
8:59
our trade is set. We have set the limit
9:01
order. We have set the target profit and
9:03
we have set the stop loss. Uh let's see
9:05
how it plays out. So the price is
9:07
actually going down to the limit order
9:09
already in the next minute. So now we
9:11
are in the long trade. Let's uh fast
9:14
forward and see what happens. So we're
9:16
actually touching the floor of the range
9:18
here. And we're touching it one, two,
9:21
three, four, five more times before the
9:25
price eventually turns and we reach our
9:28
target profit here. And this is a cherry
9:30
picked. So if we look back, we have this
9:32
pattern here too. So, we have a positive
9:34
opening. We use the Fibonacci levels.
9:38
So, we're entering the short trade here
9:41
and then we're overextending the ceiling
9:43
a little bit, but with the stop loss
9:46
here, we're fine. And then we hit the
9:49
target profit. So, again, a perfect
9:50
trade. So, the day before that, uh, we
9:54
make no trade because we only enter
9:56
trades in the opposite direction of the
10:00
direction of the manipulation candle.
10:01
Let's go to the previous day. So, here
10:04
we have a positive opening. I'm going to
10:07
draw up the Fibonacci levels.
10:10
So, we're placing the short limit order
10:12
here. We enter the short trade and then
10:15
we reach the to profit just uh minutes
10:18
later. So, this is a a classic touch and
10:20
turn. I wanted to show you a losing
10:22
trade as well. And I actually had to
10:25
scroll all the way back to December 15th
10:28
to find one. So, here's a losing trade.
10:30
We have the opening range here. Here we
10:32
enter the trade when the price touches
10:34
the range floor, but it never turns
10:37
around. So, we're actually breaking out
10:39
of the range and we reach the stop-loss
10:42
here. So, that's like one loss in the
10:45
whole of December. I mean, this
10:47
strategy, it works great and it's been
10:50
working for decades. It has worked so
10:52
well in fact that I decided to build a
10:54
trading bot out of it so that I can just
10:56
let it trade this touch and turn scalper
10:58
on any index on any stock at any time
11:01
and I'm going to give it to you. It's
11:04
free but in return maybe you could
11:06
scroll down and give this video a thumbs
11:08
up. I appreciate it. So I'm going to
11:11
trade this strategy in a live market.
11:12
But before we do that let's go through
11:14
these three steps once again make them a
 Recap of the Three steps
11:16
little bit clearer. So first we wait for
11:19
the 15minute candle to close. So in this
11:21
example it's a red negative opening
11:24
candle. And when that's done we do the
11:26
first step which is to Fibonaccriy this
11:28
opening range into the future so that we
11:30
get a clear visual of the opening range
11:32
and the target profit level.
11:43
So that's step one. Step two is to
11:45
confirm that this is a liquidity candle.
11:51
Again, you do that by taking the average
11:54
true range for the last 14 days and
11:56
confirming that the range of this candle
11:59
is at least 25% of that. If we can
12:02
confirm that, then we move on to the
12:04
third and last step, which is to set up
12:06
the perfect trade. So, we do that by
12:08
going to the one minute time frame and
12:10
we are placing a limit order. So, we're
12:12
going to place a limit order that is
12:14
going long and we're going to place it
12:17
at the low of the range. And we do that
12:20
because the manipulation candle was red.
12:22
So, we're placing the long limit order
12:24
here.
12:27
And then we want to set the target
12:29
profit level to the 38.2
12:32
Fibonacci level.
12:37
And then we set the stop loss to be half
12:41
of the target profit level. So half of
12:43
this range.
12:47
Okay. So now we have set up the perfect
12:49
trade. We have the limit order level. We
12:51
have the takerit level. And we have the
12:53
stop-loss level. And that's the three
12:55
steps. That's all we need to do. So let
12:57
me show you what usually happens after
12:59
50-minut opening range. The price go up
13:01
for a bit, maybe for 3 minutes, and then
13:04
we start going down again.
13:06
So what usually happens is that the
13:09
price will do a touch and turn again at
13:12
the bottom of the range. The price goes
13:13
down, we touch here and the limit order
13:16
is executed
13:19
and then reach the target profit level.
13:24
And why do we usually reach the target
13:27
profit level? Why does this strategy
13:29
have such a high win rate? Well, because
 Why the Strategy Has a High Win Rate (4 Market Scenarios)
13:31
there are only four possible scenarios
13:33
where the price can go every day. And
13:35
with three of these scenarios, the price
13:38
will pass through our target profit
13:40
level. So scenario one is that we push
13:42
through the range. But before we do
13:44
that, in most cases, the price will go
13:47
up to collect strength at least once
13:50
before pushing through. Scenario two is
13:52
that we will stay within the range the
13:54
whole day, which means that price will
13:56
bounce back and forth within the range,
13:58
which means that the price will pass
14:00
through the target profit level.
14:02
Scenario three is that we have a full
14:05
reversal of the price and break out of
14:08
the range on the upside. This still
14:10
means that price will pass through the
14:13
target profit level. The only scenario
14:15
where we actually don't reach the target
14:17
profit level is if the price breaks
14:20
through on the first touch of the range.
14:26
Scenario one is a win. Scenario two is a
14:28
win. Scenario three is a win. four is a
14:32
loss. But as these back tests shows,
14:35
that happens less than 30% of the time.
14:37
Now, let me show you how to trade this
14:40
live. It's already 100 p.m., so I missed
14:43
the uh market open, but I will be back
 Live Trade Example (Meta on Christmas Eve)
14:45
tomorrow to trade this together with
14:47
you. Good morning, guys. It's about 10
14:49
minutes until the market opens. And
14:50
today, I'm going to trade this touch and
14:52
turn scalper live. And remember the
14:55
steps. So, we're first going to what I
14:57
call Fibonaccify the first 15minute
15:00
opening range candle. And then we're
15:02
going to confirm that this candle is a
15:04
liquidity candle. And third, we're going
15:07
to dial in the perfect trade. If we
15:10
don't get this trading opportunity
15:11
today, I will come back another day. But
15:13
if you're watching this, it means that I
15:15
kept it. And spoiler alert, it means
15:18
that it's happening today. Okay, so the
15:20
market opens in 2 minutes. I'm going to
15:22
trade this on Meta today. And let's
15:25
start by finding out what the average
15:26
true range is. So, I'm going to go to
15:29
the daily chart. I'm going to pull up
15:31
the average true range indicator. The
15:33
average range is 17.75
15:38
bucks. Let's uh let's write that down.
15:44
And let's go back to the 15minut time
15:46
frame.
15:48
So, now the market opens in about five
15:51
seconds.
15:52
And here we go. Okay. So, it's opening
15:55
with a gap downwards. Remember, we are
15:58
waiting for this candlestick to fully
16:00
close before we can confirm that it is a
16:02
liquidity candle. And for it to be a
16:05
liquidity candle, it has to be 25% or
16:08
more of that average true range. So,
16:10
while we wait for this 15-minute candle
16:12
to close, we could actually already now
16:14
calculate that.
16:16
So, the average true range was 17.75
16:19
bucks.
16:21
25% times that is 4 bucks and 44.
16:28
So that means that if the candle has a
16:31
range that is more than four bucks 444,
16:34
it is a liquidity candle. Okay, it's now
16:38
5 seconds until this 15-minute candle
16:40
closes. The range is exceeding 4.44
16:43
bucks. Okay, so the candle closed with a
16:45
range of 4.64 64 bucks which means that
16:48
it is uh it's it's confirmed that it is
16:51
a liquidity candle. Okay. So now let's
16:53
take the Fibonacci retracement indicator
16:56
to connect the highest price point that
16:58
we see and we connect it with the lowest
17:00
price point that we see and we extend it
17:03
into the future. So the low is at 662
17:07
and the high is at 667.
17:10
So as you can see here I configured my
17:12
own Fibonacci drawing tool. So it also
17:15
displays the stop-loss levels. This
17:17
makes it even quicker to trade this
17:18
strategy and you can most likely do this
17:21
in your trading software as well. But if
17:23
you want to use the trading software
17:24
that I use, which is called Pro Time,
17:26
there is a link to that in the
17:27
description below. Okay, so this
17:29
15-minute liquidity opening range and
17:31
the Fibonacci levels that we that we
17:34
just drew, they will be of big
17:36
significance for the rest of the day. So
17:37
now the only remaining thing to do is to
17:39
place the limit order. And as this
17:41
manipulation candle was positive, we are
17:43
looking to make a limit order to go
17:45
short at the top of the range. And we do
17:48
that on a lower time frame. So we're
17:50
changing to the one minute time frame.
17:52
It's just better for control and
17:54
increased vision. So in per time, you
17:57
click here to place a limit order. And
18:00
I'm placing the short order here with
18:02
target profit at the 61.8 level and the
18:06
stop loss up here. And now we just wait.
18:09
Remember, we only want to enter the
18:11
trade if it's within the 90 minutes of
18:13
the market open. Okay, so the price
18:15
actually continues up from here. We're
18:18
getting closer to the limit order level.
18:20
Okay, so we just entered the trade here.
18:21
It's now
18:23
10:00 a.m. and let's see if it continues
18:26
up or if this is a classic touch and
18:29
turn. Okay, so the price continues up,
18:31
but we're not even halfway to the stop
18:33
loss. This is what I want to see. The
18:35
price is now turning down again. This is
18:37
very promising. Price is going down.
18:39
It's going more down now. We just want
18:41
it to push a couple of cents more and we
18:43
are at the target profit here. We
 Outro
18:45
reached the target profit and our trade
18:46
is now closed. We are in the money. Time
18:49
is now 10:28. Okay guys, that's going to
18:53
conclude today's video. I hope you found
18:55
some value in this touch and turn
18:57
scalper. Let me know how it works out
18:59
for you. I have other strategies in my
19:01
arsenal as well. Let me know in the
19:03
comments and I will make another video
19:05
like this. And I would like to end with
19:08
one reminder and that is that historic
19:10
results are no guarantee for future
19:12
results. So even though this strategy
19:14
has been proven effective over years and
19:17
decades, it might stop working. So
19:20
please evaluate it regularly and please
19:22
know that this strategy works better in
19:24
some stocks and worse in others. So you
19:27
need to evaluate it on the stock that
19:29
you are trading. Okay guys, take care,
19:31
trade well and uh thank you for
19:33
watching.
19:35
Bye.
19:44
Okay.
