## 1. Setup

1. **Paste** `KeyLevelBreakout.pine` into TradingView Pine Editor, click **Add to chart**. Works on any timeframe at or below Signal Timeframe (e.g. 1m chart with 5m signals).
2. **Enable Extended Trading Hours** in chart settings (gear icon → Symbol → Extended Hours). Required for premarket level tracking.
3. **Add alert** → Condition: `Key Level Breakout` → `Any alert() function call`. This single alert covers all signal types, confirmations, retests, failures, VWAP exits, and QBS/MC.

---

## 2. Signal Types

Six signal types, each with a specific trigger and visual style.

**Breakout** — Signal-TF bar closes through a key level as a directional candle (bullish or bearish), with prior bar(s) on the other side of the level. Green labels (bull) / red labels (bear).

**Reversal (~)** — Wick enters a level zone, close rejects back out. Bullish reversals fire at LOW levels (blue labels), bearish reversals at HIGH levels (orange labels). No volume gate — reversals are judged by rejection quality, not volume.

**Reclaim (~~)** — Reversal after a prior breakout at that level was invalidated (CONF ✗). "False breakout then rejection." Same color scheme as reversals, brighter hue. Requires CONF system to be ON for the invalidation context.

**Retest (◆)** — After a breakout, price pulls back to the broken level within configurable proximity and holds. Each broken level is tracked independently. Fires an independent label at the retest bar (e.g. `◆³ ORB H 2.1x ^85`) and also appends a retest line to the original breakout label. The superscript number is the count of signal-TF bars since breakout.

**QBS (🔇 Quiet Before Storm)** — Pre-move volume drying (ramp < 0.5×) followed by a big bar (range ≥ 1.5× signal-TF ATR). Cyan labels. Once per direction per session. Does not require a key-level breakout.

**MC (🔊 Momentum Cascade)** — Pre-move volume surging (ramp > 5×) followed by a big bar (range ≥ 1.5× signal-TF ATR). Orange labels. Once per direction per session. Does not require a key-level breakout.

### Direction Reference

| Setup | At HIGH level | At LOW level |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Breakout | ▲ LONG (green) | ▼ SHORT (red) |
| Reversal ~ | ▼ SHORT (orange) | ▲ LONG (blue) |
| Reclaim ~~ | ▼ SHORT (orange, brighter) | ▲ LONG (blue, brighter) |
| Retest ◆ | Confirms original break direction | Confirms original break direction |

QBS and MC signals are direction-agnostic relative to levels — they fire based on candle direction (close > open = bull, close < open = bear).

---

## 3. Label Anatomy

Every label stacks information on separate lines. A fully-loaded example:

```
⚡🔇 ORB L + PM L
5.5x ^92 ④ ⚠
◆³ ORB L 2.1x ^85
✓★
```

Line 1: `⚡🔇 ORB L + PM L` — Big-move flag, volume ramp glyph, level names (merged when confluent).
Line 2: `5.5x ^92 ④ ⚠` — Volume ratio, close position, Runner Score, body warning.
Line 3: `◆³ ORB L 2.1x ^85` — Retest line (per-level, superscript = signal bars since breakout).
Line 4: `✓★` — Confirmation status.

### Metrics Reference

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `2.1x` | Volume ratio vs SMA(20) baseline | 2.1× average volume |
| `^82` | Bull close position (82% toward bar high) | — |
| `v85` | Bear close position (85% toward bar low) | — |
| `◆³` | Retest, 3 signal bars after breakout | — |
| `✓` | Confirmed (auto-promoted) | Solid green/red, white text |
| `✓★` | High-conviction confirmed (≥5× vol + ≥80% pos) | Gold label, black text |
| `✗` | Failed (closed back through level) | Grayed out |
| `~` | Reversal (rejection off zone) | Blue/orange label |
| `~~` | Reclaim (reversal after failed breakout) | Blue/orange, brighter |
| `①`–`⑤` | Runner Score (5 factors) | Higher = more factors aligned |
| `⚡` | Big move (bar range ≥ 2× signal-TF ATR) | Informational marker (no size change) |
| `🔇` | Vol drying (ramp < 0.5×) — quiet before storm | Cyan label for standalone QBS |
| `🔊` | Vol surging (ramp > 5×) — momentum cascade | Orange label for standalone MC |
| `⚠` | Body ≥ 80% — fakeout warning | Appended to quality line |
| `?` | Dimmed signal (failed filter or moderate ramp) | Gray, size.tiny |
| `CHOP?` | 3+ consecutive CONF failures at session open | Orange label, no passes yet |

---

## 4. Confirmation System

The CONF system tracks whether a breakout "survives" or fails.

**Auto-promote (✓):** When a new breakout fires in the same direction, the previous breakout's label is promoted to ✓ — it survived long enough for another signal to follow. 100% of CONF passes use this mechanism.

**CONF ✓** — Label turns solid green (bull) or solid red (bear) with white text. Label resizes to `size.normal`.

**CONF ✓★** — Gold label with black text. Requires the original signal to have had ≥5× volume ratio AND ≥80% close position. Same resize to `size.normal`.

**CONF ✗** — Label turns gray. Fires when price closes back through the most conservative level (lowest for bull breakouts, highest for bear) beyond the re-arm buffer. Resets the level for new signals.

**5-minute checkpoint** — One signal-TF bar after CONF ✓/✓★, evaluates P&L relative to the confirming breakout's close. Appends `5m✓` (positive P&L = hold) or `5m✗` (negative P&L = bail) to the confirmed label. Fires a HOLD or BAIL alert.

**VWAP exit alert** — After CONF ✓/✓★, monitors for price crossing VWAP against the confirmed direction. Fires an alert when a bull position crosses below VWAP, or a bear position crosses above VWAP. Resets at session start.

## 5. Levels

Nine level types across five sources.

| Level Type | Source | Zone Width | Reset |
|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Premarket H/L | 04:00–09:30 ET live bars | ATR-derived (configurable, default 3%) | Daily |
| Yesterday H/L | Prior day candle (non-repainting) | Wick-to-body range from daily OHLC | Daily |
| Last Week H/L | Prior week candle (non-repainting) | Wick-to-body range from weekly OHLC | Weekly |
| ORB H/L | First signal-TF bar of regular session | ATR-derived (configurable, default 3%) | Daily |
| VWAP zone | Session VWAP ± 0.1× daily ATR | ATR-derived, continuous | Continuous |

**Zones:** When "Use Level Zones" is ON, each level expands to a range:
- Yesterday/Week: body edge (min/max of open, close) to wick edge (high/low). Wide zone = strong rejection area.
- PM/ORB: ATR-derived fixed width above and below the wick price.
- VWAP: ± 0.1× daily ATR around the live VWAP value.

Zone bands are visible as shaded fills when Show Level Lines is ON.

**ORB guard:** The first signal-TF bar after the ORB window is skipped for ORB signals, since that bar's data formed the ORB itself (self-referencing).

---

## 6. Filters

Nine configurable filters. Each can be independently toggled. Filter Mode controls what happens to blocked signals.

| Filter | What it does | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Volume | Requires signal-TF volume > multiplier × SMA(20). Uses directional 2-bar lookback (borrows prior bar's volume if same direction). | ON, 1.5× |
| ATR Buffer | Wick must push past level ± X% of daily ATR; close must hold beyond the raw level price. | ON, 5% |
| VWAP Direction | Suppresses counter-trend reversals: bear reversals above VWAP, bull reversals below VWAP. | ON |
| Once Per Breakout | One signal per level per direction. Re-arms when price closes back through level (invalidation). | ON |
| 5m EMA Alignment | Blocks signals against the 5m EMA(20)/EMA(50) trend direction. | ON |
| RS vs SPY | Blocks long signals when the symbol underperforms SPY (and vice versa for shorts). Auto-bypasses SPY, QQQ, GLD, SLV. | ON |
| ADX > 20 | Blocks signals when 5m ADX(14) < 20 (choppy/trendless environment). | ON |
| Candle Body Quality | Blocks wick-heavy candles: body < 30% of range, or close in the wrong 40% of the bar. | ON |
| Filter Mode | **Suppress:** filtered signals are hidden entirely. **Dim:** filtered signals show as gray with `?` suffix, size.tiny. | Suppress |

Breakout signals must pass both Volume and ATR Buffer. Reversal/reclaim signals must pass VWAP Direction but do not require the Volume gate. QBS/MC signals pass through the reversal filter gate (EMA, RS, ADX, Body).

## 7. Visual Elements

### Chart Overlays

| Element | Style | When Visible |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| VWAP line | Orange (`#FF6D00`), width 2, semi-transparent | Regular session, when Show VWAP Line ON |
| SL 0.10 ATR | Orange dashed, width 1 | 30 min after CONF ✓/✓★ signal |
| SL 0.15 ATR | Red solid, width 1 | 30 min after CONF ✓/✓★ signal |
| PM H/L lines | Orange, width 1 | Regular session, when Show Level Lines ON |
| Yest H/L lines | Blue, width 1 | Regular session, when Show Level Lines ON |
| Week H/L lines | Purple, width 1 | Regular session, when Show Level Lines ON |
| ORB H/L lines | Teal, width 1 | Regular session, when Show Level Lines ON |
| Zone fills | Same color as level line, 85% transparent | When Show Level Lines ON + Use Level Zones ON |

SL line duration adapts to chart timeframe: 1800 seconds / timeframe-in-seconds = number of bars. On a 1m chart, SL lines extend 30 bars. Entry proxy is the confirming breakout's close price.

### Label Modifiers

| Condition | Visual Effect |
|-----------|--------------|
| Afternoon (after 11:00 ET) | Smaller size, more transparent |
| Cooldown (within N signal bars of prior signal) | Gray, size.tiny |
| Confluence (2+ levels on same bar) | size.large |
| Big move (⚡, range ≥ 2× signal-TF ATR) | Glyph only, no size change (v2.8b: data showed 48% lower MFE) |
| Moderate vol ramp (1–2× ramp ratio) | Auto-dimmed: gray + `?` |
| CONF ✓ / ✓★ | Resized to size.normal, color changed |
| Volume-scaled opacity | Alpha = max(0, 60 − volRatio × 10), saturates at 6× |

## 8. Alerts

### Programmatic Alerts (via "Any alert() function call")

These fire through `alert()` calls. A single TradingView alert set to "Any alert() function call" catches all of them.

| `Bullish reversal: ~ PM L 1.9x ^75` | Bull reversal fires |
| `Bearish reversal: ~ Yest H 2.0x v80` | Bear reversal fires |
| `Retest: ◆³ ORB H 2.1x ^85` | Retest detected at broken level |
| `Failed: ORB H + Yest H` | Breakout invalidated (CONF ✗) |
| `5m HOLD ▲ +0.12 ATR` | 5-minute checkpoint positive |
| `5m BAIL ▲ -0.05 ATR` | 5-minute checkpoint negative |
| `VWAP exit ▼ — bull CONF position crossed below VWAP` | VWAP exit triggered |
| `🔇 QBS Bull: vol drying → explosion 0.3x` | QBS signal fires |

## 10. Signal Timeframe

Signal TF (default 5m) controls which candle closes are evaluated for breakout, reversal, reclaim, and QBS/MC signals. The chart can run on any lower timeframe (e.g. 1m) for visual detail — labels are identical regardless of chart TF.

Level tracking uses chart-native data for granularity (premarket high/low updates every chart bar). Retest detection uses chart-TF bars for wick precision. SL line duration is computed in chart-TF bars (1800s / bar duration).

All signal-TF data is fetched via `request.security()` with `lookahead = barmerge.lookahead_on` and `[1]` offset for non-repainting behavior.

---

## 11. Runner Score

Five factors, each worth 1 point, displayed as ①–⑤ on labels.

| Factor | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| VWAP aligned | Close above VWAP (bull) or below VWAP (bear) |
| Volume ≥ 5× | Volume ratio ≥ 5.0× SMA(20) baseline |
| Time 9:30–10:00 | Signal fires in the first 30 minutes of regular session |
| Not D-tier symbol | Symbol is not AMD, MSFT, GLD, or TSM |
| Level quality | **Bear:** always +1 (bear breakouts are at LOW levels, which have higher follow-through). **Bull:** +1 only when 2+ levels break simultaneously (confluence). |

Score is capped at ⑤. Only displayed when score ≥ 1 and Runner Score is enabled.

## 12. Debug

### Signal Table

Chart overlay table showing all session signals. Columns: Time, Dir, Type, Levels, Vol, Pos, Conf, OHLC. Color-coded by setup type. Configurable position and max rows (5–50).

### Pine Logs

`log.info()` output with `[KLB]` prefix, gated by `barstate.isconfirmed` to prevent duplicate entries on real-time ticks.

Format:
```
[KLB] 9:40 ▲ BRK PM H vol=5.5x pos=^94 vwap=above ema=bull rs=+0.3% adx=28 body=72% O595.20 H596.10 L594.80 C596.05 ATR=1.25 SL=595.93/595.86 rawVol=1234567 volSMA=224000 buf=0.063 prices=596.10
```

Fields: time (ET), direction, type, levels, vol (ratio), pos (close position), vwap (above/below), ema (bull/bear trend), rs (% vs SPY), adx (5m value), body (candle body %), OHLC, ATR, SL (0.10/0.15 ATR), rawVol, volSMA, buf (ATR buffer), prices (level values).

Confirmation state changes log separately with `[KLB] CONF` prefix.
